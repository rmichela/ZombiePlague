===== Overview =====

Zombie plague is a plugin that simulates a zombie apocalypse. Players who are
bitten by a zombie contract a point of zombie damage for each bite. Zombie
damage continues to deal damage over time until healed by eating cake. If the
player dies from zombie damage, a zombie spawns where they died.

==== Back Story ====
Day 22: Jenkins has fallen gravely ill. While exploring a nearby cave in search
of resources to illuminate our hovel, he was assaulted by what he described as
"a rotting mass of bones and flesh that reeked of death." 

According to his account, Jenkins brandished his sword and struck down the beast 
but not before receiving a terrible bite to the forearm. Since his injury two 
days ago, Jenkins has developed a terrible fever and moans from the pain. The 
rest of the party is getting restless. We haven't left the encampment since his 
injury for fear of encountering another creature. We can only hope for a speedy 
recovery.


Day 25: I cannot begin to describe my sense of loss. First Jenkins, and now
Prattwit! I'll do my best to recount the past eighteen hours but I panic and
chaos may have mottled the details.

At 9:25 this morning Jenkins was pronounced dead - succumbed to his injuries
or so we thought. With somber hearts we began the internment but something
went very wrong. Jenkins was not dead! However, our elation was cut brutally
short when we realized that the animated corpse rising before us was only
superficially Jenkins. What shred of humanity was left in it died in the night.

Before we could react, Prattwit was torn limb from limb from the groaning beast!
The horror! I had known Prattwit since childhood. We managed to seal the beast
in the antechamber using a stack of lumber and then retreated to the safety of
the second floor. It's still down there - moaning. I do not know what to do.


Day 35: We had a tremendous scientific breakthrough today. I've been
experimenting with the materials of this world and have discovered a possible
cure to the pox that befell Jenkins and Prattwit. After injecting the Prattwit
monster with a slurry of milk, eggs, sugar and wheat, I witnessed for the first
time a regression of the symptoms. For a moment I saw the tormented eyes of a
man behind the rotting death-mask of the monster. Then death took it. I believe
with some refinement I can work this concoction into a viable antidote to the
monster plague!


Day 37: Success! After eleven trials I have found that in the right proportions
the monster antidote can be molded into a brick for safe storage, transport,
and consumption. The Congealed Antidote K Extract, or CAKE for short has proven
successful in initial trials but I found it has a weakness. Once unpacked from
its box, the mold is too fragile for further transport and must be consumed
on the spot. Any attempt to move the CAKE has destroyed the CAKE. I will
continue to refine the recipe. We shall no longer fear the darkness!
